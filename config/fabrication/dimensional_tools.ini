; tweak.

; Block-to-dimension associations. Blocks that are associated with a dimension
; deal extra damage to incompatible tools. Normally, these associations only 
; apply if the block is *in* the dimension it's associated with, but if you
; suffix the dimension with a ! then the block will always apply dimensional
; effects. You can use tags by prefixing with a #; Fabrication's INI loader
; only recognizes semicolon as a comment. You can associate a block with more
; than one dimension by specifying it multiple times.
; 
; Note: No checking is performed that a dimension ID refers to an extant
; dimension, so you can use this to describe non-dimensional relationships too
; if you like.

; Assign damage factors when using tools associated with a given dimension
; on blocks associated with another. Syntax is tool dimension, then a greater
; than sign (>), then the block dimension. Either dimension, but not both, can
; be *, in which case it matches all dimensions except the one on the other
; side of the >. For example, *>the_nether matches all non-Nether tools that
; are being used on Nether blocks. overworld>* matches all Overworld tools that
; are being used on non-Overworld blocks. * also matches tools and blocks with
; no associated dimension.
; 
; Negative values result in *less* damage being dealt rather than more. You may
; specify "Infinity" instead of a number to make the tool break instantly, or
; specify "0" to make the tool take no damage.
;
; If a tool has more than one dimension, if it matches only positive values,
; the greatest one will be used. If it matches a mixture of negative and
; positive values, or only matches negatives, the least (furthest from zero)
; will be used. If it matches 0 at all, that will be used.
;
; If a tool matches more than one damage factor *for a given dimension*, then
; fully specified (A>B) values are preferred, then "against foreign block"
; values (A>*), then finally "foreign tool against block" values (*>A).
