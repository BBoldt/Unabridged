    # Setting this to true will have the grave try to place itself above bodies of liquid (water, lava, etc...). If a valid location is not found at the top, it will still attempt to place the grave near the actual location of death. (Defaults to false)

    # If this is true, spawned graves will default to being locked and will need to be unlocked (via shift-clicking) in order to get items back. (Defaults to true)

    # If true, graves will display their owner's name above them when looking at the block. (Defaults to true)

inventory {
    # If set to true, a file will be generated for each player death, allowing OPs to restore a player's inventory from the file. Note that these files are *per machine*, that means you could potentially restore inventories from other worlds in single-player (or servers if you don't delete the inventory data). Setting this to false will disable any command that requires use of the backups to operate (restore, drop, and loot commands). (Defaults to true)
