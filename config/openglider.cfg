    S:"2) Overall Power"=1.0

    # The size of the wind gusts, larger values mean the gusts push the player around in greater angles from their intended direction. Default is moderately sized. Observable gameplay effects are highly tied with wind frequency. [range: 1.0 ~ 100.0, default: 19.0]

    # The player's y-level/height changes the overall wind effect by this multiplier. Default is that the higher you are up in the world the stronger the wind is, but only by a moderate amount. 0 means the player's height has no effect on the wind. [range: -10.0 ~ 10.0, default: 1.5]
    S:"7) Height Multiplier"=1.5

    # The glider's durability remaining changes the overall wind effect by this additional amount. 0 means the glider's durability won't effect the wind power, whereas 1 will mean a nearly broken glider is affected by wind about twice as much as a new one. [range: 0.0 ~ 5.0, default: 0.7]
