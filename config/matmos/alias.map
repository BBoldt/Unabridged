# This file contains comma-separated alias mappings like:
#
# torch=SomeCoolMod:cool_torch,SomeOtherMod:other_torch
# sword=SomeCoolMod:cool_sword,SomeOtherMod:other_sword
#
# Block/item names on the right side of the mapping will be counted as if they
# were blocks/items on the left side, with the exception of blocks/items that
# are mentioned in an expansion.
# (So if an expansion had a different sound for the cool_torch, it wouldn't get
# dealiased as the torch.)
#
# Additional features:
#
#   1. You can import other alias files like this:
#      :import some_other_file.map
#
#   2. This will map all blocks/items matching the oredict entry "blockDirt" to
#      dirt
#      dirt=:blockDirt
#
#   3. There's glob-style matching too: * is a wildcard for zero or more chars
#      dirt=somemod:dirt*
#
#   4. You can disable warnings originating from this file or an imported file:
#      :disableWarnings
#
# Tip: restart MAtmos to reload the aliases without having to restart Minecraft
