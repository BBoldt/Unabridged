# Tip: restart MAtmos to reload the configs without restarting Minecraft

# There's a bug in Minecraft's sound system that causes it to crash after some time if looping streams are played.
# Forge provides a fix for this in 1.12.2, but MAtmos has to provide its own fix on 1.7.10, and on LiteLoader versions.
# Use this option to control when the SoundSystem should be overridden.
# 
# Allowed values are: always, never, auto (which only overrides if no other mod is present which also overrides it (like DynamicSurroundings on 1.7.10, or Forge itself on 1.12.2))
