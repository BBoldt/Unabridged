[spawning]

	#This is a list of spawner data that will used to add spawn entries to biomes as they load.
	#CHANGES TO THIS CONFIG REQUIRE A SERVER RESTART TO TAKE EFFECT
	#Each entry has the following fields:
	#weight -- Spawning weight in the biome; higher number == spawn more often relative to other mobs (zombies have 100, usually)
	#min -- Minimum group size to attempt to spawn (typically 1)
	#max -- Maximum group size to attempt to spawn (typically 4)
	#include -- A mandatory list of biome identifiers (more info below)
	#exclude -- An optional list of biome identifiers
	#require -- An optional list of biome identifiers
	#For each biome defined in the include list, this spawn entry will be added to that biome as they load, UNLESS:
	#  the biome is in the exclude list, or the require list is non-empty and the biome is not in the require list
	#A biome identifier can either be a resource location identifying a single biome (e.g. minecraft:swamp)
	#OR a Forge BiomeDictionary identifier identifying a set of biomes, in all caps (e.g. WET)
	#A list of the default BiomeDictionary keys is available here:
	#https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.16.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/common/BiomeDictionary.java
	#Be aware that adding multiple spawn entries that permit spawning in the same biome will cause a spawn entry
	#  to be added to that biome twice, likely causing froglins to spawn more often
