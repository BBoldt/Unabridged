Thank you for using sprinkles_for_vanilla! The config starts when you get to the large line of hyphens (-). This means you can safely remove or add things before that line.

I suggest you include a list of changes you have made to the config file before that line in case anyone who is looking through your pack wishes to easily see which modifications you have made with this mod.

This config file has 2 sections: Clientside features and Global Features.
- Clientside features will work all the time regardless of whether the server has the mod on the server.
- Global features will only work if the server has the mod.
- Please remember that in Single Player you are technically on your own server which does have the mod so global features will work then.
- If you join a server that does not have this mod, then the configs in the global features section will be ignored.
- Clientside features will also still work if the server does have the mod.
- If you switch between a server which does have the mod to a server which doesn't have the mod, it will be detected and the configs will be used.
- If the server and the client have different configs then the client will be sent the server configs and use them
- You will be notified in the console if the server does not have the mod or if the configs are different so make sure you watch out for that.

If you accidentally remove a feature and are getting an error related to this config, you can delete it and it will be regenerated for you.

I shall also point out that there must be no spaces between the config entry, the equals sign "=" and the value set to it.
The reason for this is because there are certain config values which take strings (sentences or words) that may allow for it to start with a space.
However, if the value is in a list such as sounds, whitespace will be ignored before the first character

DO NOT REMOVE OR ALTER THIS LINE OR THE MOD VERSION

        # The trades must be in the format of 'villagerId, chance, itemBeingSold, itemToGive1, itemToGive2'. villagerId is the type of villager this trade is added to. Refer
        # to the third column of http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Villager#Professions_and_careers for ID. The chance is a number between 0 and 1 which determines whether it can
        # be a possibility. If the chance is 0.6 there is a 60% chance it will be added to the possibilities, then out of all the possibilities a random trade is chosen.
        # The Items must be in the format 'modname:itemOrBlockName:metadata(min-max)', the min and the max is a range that the stack size for the trade can be, if you wish the
        # stack size to always be the same, set min and max to the same number. The metadata is optional and can be removed by removing the ':metadata' part. itemToGive2 is also
        # optional and can be omitted by removing ', itemToGive2'. Putting a '#' in front of an option will comment it out and ignore it. If you have any questions please PM
        # me (VikeStep) and I will help explain it. I should also mention that putting a trade in this list multiple times will increase its chance as well.
